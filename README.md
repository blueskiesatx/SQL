# homweork solutions
I included the homework solutions to basic MySQL practice questions. For example:

-- 1a Display the first and last names of all actors from the table actor
USE sakila;
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM actor;

-- 1b Display the first and last name of each actor in a single column 
-- in upper case letters. Name the column Actor Name
SELECT upper(concat(first_name,' ', last_name)) AS Actor_Name
FROM actor;
