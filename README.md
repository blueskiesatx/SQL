# homework solutions
I included the homework solutions to basic MySQL practice questions. For example:

# 1a Display the first and last names of all actors from the table actor

USE sakila;

SELECT first_name, last_name FROM actor;


# 1b Display the first and last name of each actor in a single column

# in upper case letters. Name the column Actor Name

SELECT upper(concat(first_name,' ', last_name)) AS Actor_Name

FROM actor;
